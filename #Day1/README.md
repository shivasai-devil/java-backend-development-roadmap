# 🚀 Day 1 – Kickstart to Java!

Today marks the beginning of my backend engineering journey.  
These are the first Java programs I wrote to build my fundamentals.

## 🔥 Highlights of the Day
- Installed JDK + IntelliJ + Git
- Wrote first Java program
- Understood Java syntax and structure
- Practiced input, conditions, loops & validation

## 📂 Programs Written
- ✔ Hello.java  
- ✔ AboutMe.java

## 💭 Key Thoughts
> "Great developers are not born, they are built — one day, one commit at a time."

### ⭐ Tomorrow's Goal:  
Move from *writing programs* → *writing real classes and objects (OOP)*
